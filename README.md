_Where Culture Meets Protocol_  
_Where Memes Become Movement_

MEME is the cultural ignition layer of UNIVERSE.  
It’s not a campaign — it’s a **field of memetic alignment**.

> This is where curiosity is sparked, not instructed.  
> Where the soul of the protocol is felt — before it is understood.

## Purpose

To transmit clarity through symbols.  
To reflect truth through humor, rhythm, and resonance.  
To seed participation without coercion.

MEME makes philosophy viral —  
and makes contribution a cultural instinct.

## Meme as OS

Memes are not entertainment.  
They are **semiotic carriers of alignment**.

- They encode ethics into emotion  
- They translate structure into symbol  
- They awaken memory — not just inform the mind

> A meme is not a joke — it’s a **mirror**, a **signal**, a **spark**.

## UNIVERSE.MEME

The portal to the protocol's soul.  
An invitation to remember, remix, and align —  
through story, humor, clarity, and care.

> You don’t follow a meme.  
> You resonate with it.

## The MOMENTUM Engine (coming soon)

A resonance engine for memetic coordination.  
Not a task board — a pulse amplifier.

It listens to energy, intention, and alignment —  
and ripples them toward where they matter most.

<br>

**Make memes like they matter.**  
Because in UNIVERSE — they do.

> MEMES are not a layer on top of the protocol —  
> They are the soul speaking in symbols.
